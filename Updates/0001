[spoiler="Village Culture"]
[b]Kageship:[/b] 

Tanbogakure is an anomaly in the shinobi world for its dual kageship. Unlike many villages that adhere to the practice of a single kage aided by a lesser deputy kage, the village hidden in the rice paddies splits the role of kage into two equally senior roles, both referred to as the Komekage. One of these roles takes command over the village's military interests, while the other plots the village's economic and cultural course. In the absence of a sitting counterpart, one kage rules over both domains with absolute authority.

Furthermore, adopting the tradition from Rice Country's many agricultural collectives, Tanbogakure's dual kageship is decided by majority rule wherein each seat is filled by a village-wide poll. Every lawful citizen of Tanbogakure has the right and ability to become kage given enough popular support. One may call a kage's leadership into question and demand a vote of no confidence from the populace at large as they see fit, but the motion must be seconded by another individual to be considered valid. From there, whoever garners the most votes ascends to the seat of kage. In the event of a tie, the election goes into a runoff until the victor is decided.

[b]Laws:[/b]

[u]International Neutrality:[/u] 

As a major exporter of foodstuffs the world over, Tanbogakure—and Rice Country at large—remains militarily neutral in international conflicts unless first attacked. This law does not, however, preclude the practice of preferential economic and diplomatic treatment when the tenor of the time calls for it.

[u]Meritocracy:[/u]

Eschewing much of the wider world's bureaucracy, shinobi and kunoichi of Tanbogakure can expect to be rewarded for their service to the village. After completing the mission requirements for a given power rank, characters may claim the in-character rank that corresponds to their new power rank up to jounin rank (e.g. a D-rank genin completes the mission requirements for C power rank, then they are also automatically promoted to chuunin). Note: advancing your power rank in ways other than missions is not covered in this law and must be adjudicated in character with one of the Komekage.  

[u]Freelance Opportunities:[/u]

Further more, Tanbogakure lacks the resources and personnel that many of the larger villages possess.  As a trade hub, the village sees many different individuals from many different places.  With this in mind, the village does allow for freelance workers to perform duties providing they are in good standing with the village up to and including official missions.  This applies to any non-affiliated person who has registered with the village as a visitor and is considered in good standing.  In accordance with their international neutrality, individuals who are affiliated with another village are excluded from this rule as to not be held responsible for injuries they may incur during work. 

[u]Mandatory Community Service:[/u]

Active shinobi and kunoichi of Tanbogakure must spend one week out of the year helping with the year's rice crop. This is instituted on the honor system and is meant to foster a deeper appreciation for the land they protect. Most shinobi and kunoichi will help around harvest time, but there are no set guidelines around when one has to help.

[b]Transplant Leniency:[/b] 

As a general rule, the practice of transplanting the body parts of another onto oneself for the sole purpose of personal power is frowned upon. Though not outright forbidden, the practice is considered unnatural in the extreme, and those who do so are often considered freaks and outcasts. The only real exception to this is in cases of medical necessity. 

[b]Criminal Leniency[/b] Moderate

The village frowns on criminal activity inside its jurisdiction and will take action to remove its sources, though in certain circumstances it can be justified and overlooked. Circumstances are judged on a more case-by-case basis than by a strict code. That said, criminal actions need a very good reason to escape prosecution. 

[b]Missing Ninja Tolerance:[/b] Moderate
